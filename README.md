# COVID-19 Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting COVID-19 outcomes using machine learning models.
The goal of this project is to develop predictive models that can forecast the progression and severity of COVID-19 in patients. By analyzing patient data, the models aim to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding patient care and resource allocation.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms: LSTM, GRU, VAR
- Model evaluation and validation
- Visualization of results

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises anonymized patient records, including demographic information, clinical features, and COVID-19 outcomes. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset is not included in this repository. Researchers interested in accessing the data should contact the relevant data providers or use publicly available datasets that comply with ethical guidelines.
